# -Exploratory-Natural-Language-Processing-on-Yelp-Data-Using-R


This code repository contains an exploratory analysis of Yelp data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in R. The purpose of this project is to gain insights from textual reviews and extract valuable feedback for businesses to improve their services.

The code performs the following steps:

**Tokenization**: The text data is tokenized, breaking it down into individual words or tokens.

**NLP Cleaning**: Various preprocessing techniques are applied to clean the text data. This includes removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing special characters.

**Stopword Removal**: Common stopwords (e.g., "the," "and," "is") are removed from the text, as they do not contribute significantly to the analysis.

**Lemmatization and Stemming**: The code utilizes lemmatization and stemming algorithms to reduce words to their base forms, improving text normalization.

**Top Mentioned Words**: The code identifies the top 70 most frequently mentioned words in the Yelp reviews.

**Bigrams and Trigrams**: The code generates 50 bigrams (pairs of words) and 50 trigrams (sequences of three words) to capture meaningful phrases or expressions.

**Wordclouds**: The R sentiment package is used to create wordclouds representing positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. This provides a visual representation of the feedback extracted from the reviews.

The generated wordclouds serve as powerful visual tools for businesses to understand customer sentiment and identify areas for improvement. By analyzing the most mentioned words, meaningful phrases, and sentiment distributions, businesses can gain valuable insights to enhance their services and address customer concerns effectively.
