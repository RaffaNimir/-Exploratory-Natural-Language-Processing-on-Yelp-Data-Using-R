The shrimp tacos and house fries are my standbys. The fries are sometimes good and sometimes great, and the spicy dipping sauce they come with is to die for. The beer list is amazing and the cocktails are great. The prices are mid-level, so it's not a cheap dive you can go to every week, but rather a treat when you do. Try it out.

I was immediately impressed upon ordering at Bang Bang Burgers. I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!
I don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. 
The sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. 
Overall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight ""drawbacks"", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.",6/8/2015 18:56

Had lunch at Frank (on site restaurant), which was quite chic and the food was delightful, but a wee bit spendy.
The gallery itself is beautiful and interesting. I've been twice in the past 6 months (to see the Turner exhibit and the Lawren Harris exhibit), and have been impressed by both the special exhibits and the regular collections. The special collections are an additional fee, but in both cases, well worth it. 
The gallery is spacious and well lit, with an interesting mix of trad and modern art. I still need to go back again, as I didn't get to spend as much time as I would like, and am pretty sure I didn't see everything.

I stopped here late after work one night on the way home after having passed it at least a thousand times, and decided to give it a try. I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. 

The inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. 

The young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. 

I ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. 

My only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...",3/6/2016 23:58

Their service was impeccable- from the sweet hostess who was unfazed when we arrived 30 minutes late to our reservation, to the warm friendly bartender who chatted us up like we were old friends, to the waiter who was not condescending in the least bit, to the busboys who guided me back to my table when I drunkenly stumbled into the kitchen.

The food was solid. The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.

All in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!)

It's much more open and not crowded, even with open jump and other birthday parties.  Our hostess was awesome. They customize shirts for the birthday boy. Our hostess drew an awesome Super Mario shirt. The birthday party included a private dodge ball game which was so much fun. We played a few rounds and then she let us jump privately because there was no party after us.
The place feels so clean. They have a free place for your shoes and belongings and seats all around so you can watch your kids jump if you aren't jumping too, where at Sky Zone you see parents standing at the entrance or sitting on the ground in those narrow walkways. The regular jump area is nice and open and they have a separate netted off area for younger kids that the parents can also jump in. Unlike Sky Zone that have small kids to one side, 8-10 yr olds in the middle and adults to the other side. 
It's very sensory friendly also. I wish FEAT would consider hosting family nights there. I only wish they would open a location closer to my side of town.",10/13/2016 22:03

You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.

I learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.

The menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. 

My eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was ""not a mistake"". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.

I was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crÃ¨me caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!",5/20/2009 3:22

Everyone has that one vegetarian friend, right? They're always there on your tail making it so you and your friends can't get your McRib on at the local McD's and you have to make sure to reiterate her order with ""NO BEEEEEF, SUB BEANNNNNS"" at TB. Geez.. But there's no need to fear, Veggie House is here! 

I've tried a variety of dishes here and I've yet to be disappointed; Pan-Fried Noodles, Mongolian Beef, Wonton Soup, Beef Ramen, Sweet and Soup Chicken, Jasmine tea, BUN ROLL!! You need to order a fried bun roll.. Thank me later.

This place is vegan/vegetarian and they serve no meat.. What? Yes. I tell my bestie every single time that they should put quotes around all their meat products so people don't get so darn confused. Their meat, it's not real- but trust me, it's a good thing. Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the ""meat"" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great. If you have the thing and you can't do textures, you're probably safer sticking to something with veggies instead.

All the food I've had here has been really great, even if the service is a little shoddy. Don't let that deter you. 

Get the bun roll.

The food was amazing and the portion sizes were impressive. When Dave said that most people order one vegetable and one starch for the table he didn't lie. The side dishes were impressive.

6 hours round trip, 2 liters of water, holes in my shoe, change in headband, backpack tan, sunglass tan, burnt arms, sore legs, and dirt all over my body was the result of my trip at Turtlehead Peak.Making it to the top of Turtlehead Peak I was rewarded with a really nice cool breeze, an ammo box holding a signature book, and one of the best views I have ever seen in my life. Worth it? Yes. Would I do it again? Probably not. 

Would not recommend for something looking for a nice stroll in nature or a quick hike (less than 4 hours). 

What I learned from my experience and mistakes is that you should have the following items with you:

1. Excess water (better to have more than less in this case)
2. Sunblock
3. Hiking shoes or comfortable shoes that you don't mind destroying.
4. FOOD! ( I really lacked on this one, I ate prior to the hike, but all that uphill really took a toll on my energy. I appreciate the kindness of whoever left a Clifbar inside the ammo box holding the signature book. Don't think I would of made it down without one)
5. A companion
6. A map or GPS device.
7. Focus
8. Patience

P.S. Don't get off the trail like my group did within the first 15 minutes. There are trail markers for you that will make the trip a lot less strenuous and more enjoyable.

Basically I curated this woman's art, sacred objects and artifacts collection and needless to say it was a very memorable week working in what you can imagine to be a very eclectic home.  When the job finished my client invited the crew and I to a celebration dinner which brought us to a restaurant in Inglewood on 9th avenue S.E. called Sugo Caffe Italia.

Just sitting outside Sugo I felt underdressed and so did my co-workers but our appetites and curiosity managed to find our way into the restaurant where our reservation of 6 was warmly greeted by the staff.  The decor in this restaurant is exquisite, simple and clean with accents of contemporary earthy art pieces on warm muted walls.  Jarred tomatoes and jams are illuminated upwards with mini lights shining brightly from beneath them and antique chandeliers hang above dripping with crystal raindrops and lined pearl beads.  There is no corner that has not been thought out decoration wise here and the table settings are complete with artisan ceramics and fine crystal glassware.

An average meal is between 20 to 40 dollars but once you savour the many dishes on a menu that changes every evening and the many cheese options that I couldn't pronounce you are completely titillated.  Every meal's presentation has been evoked with an artist's touch and the freshest ingredients are presented in front of you to tantalize your palate.  I was extremely impressed by an ample Scotch list, over 15 choices and the huge portions of deserts that were presented in the most elegant formations that look like one could almost wear them as head pieces.

I was so impressed by Sugo the first time that I took my partner there to have our own celebration dinner the very next evening.

Absolutely 5 stars without a question.",10/14/2009 2:33

We started with what we thought would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table- what did we expect on a Friday night?  they send text notification when your table is available (love that!).

Our server, Dawn, was personable, and while we could tell she was super busy, she made sure we were taken care of, and explained any expected delay!  The menu was AMAZING!  Nothing sounded bad!  I had the snow crab boil with added vegetables (1 pound!) and corn on the cob with the Trifecta sauce at level 3 heat. My companion, the Incredible Running God, was more adventurous and had the shrimp boil (complete with ""everything that shrimp was born with"" as our server put it-eyes, tail, legs) with the Trifecta sauce in level 4 heat-""Angry ghost"". Be prepared to sweat with level 4 spice!  The kiddo had the pepperoni flatbread which sounded like a horribly boring choice, but hey, what can I expect taking a moody tweenager who hates seafood to a crab shack!  The place was packed!

The food was also top-notch, and arrived to the table quickly. I had the Eggs Benedict, and loved their thick, buttery Hollandaise sauce. Their breakfast potatoes were also very good.

I have been to Mesa Grill three times, twice for lunch, and it's one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. 

The space is huge, so even on a night you think a seat might take a while, they can typically accommodate you, so don't skip this place thinking it'll be too tough to get seated. 

Each time the service has been fantastic. 

For lunch both times I got the Green Chili Cheeseburger, which comes with some awesome spicy French fries. The sandwich has cheese, delicious green chili and picked onions. It's awesome and that's why I got it both times. 

For dinner, I got the pork, and there's was absolutely nothing left on the plate. 

The price is what you'd expect, but not outrageous. It's definitely worth the visit on your trip to Vegas.

I have received sports massages, Swedish and deep tissue. I consider La Vida to be a very good facility and Angel to be a very competent therapist. For more than 6 months I have gone once every 3-4 weeks.

I work out regularly and consider a massage a great way to heal sore muscles and low back pain from sitting at a desk all day. After my old therapist moved to Florida, I began the annoying process of trying new ones. Some have trouble dialing up or down the pressure. Some can't get the low back pain out like others. Some reek of cigarette smoke. Some are lazy, using one hand at a time instead of two.

Then I found Angel, who is quite competent. If you wanna chat, she'll chat. If you want quiet relaxation, she'll put you at ease. If you say ""I hurt here"", she will solve it. I consider one of Angel's attributes to be the fact she can dial up or down pressure just BARELY, and maintain that. She can find where it hurts and, due to her through knowledge of fascia and layers of tissue, massage the pain away. After repeat sessions, she understands I need more pressure on the right side of my spine than my left. Angel's ability to meet her clients needs combined with her through knowledge of muscle and fascia along with the ability to maintain consistent pressure make her an extremely competent therapist.

If Angel is busy or sick, Ivan is a fantastic alternative. He's an A in my book, with Angel an A+. Edit: Forgot to mention, Ivan's strengths are deep tissue and neck work. If your neck specifically is killing you or you need real deep tissue, Ivan is your man.

La Vida is an upper middle / yuppie chain massage location with ample parking. I feel strongly that these are superior to middle brow chain massage places (such as Massage Envy) and superior to upscale spas (such as Sewickly or Seven Springs or Esspa). Simply put, La Vida has lots of returning clients and as such, a steady stream of business and competent and calm massage therapists with little turnover.",2/5/2014 20:28

Thus, we actually PREFER a hotel with no casino in it. I got a Travelzoo rate several months ago for $109/nt for a King Suite with a view.

When we arrived, check-in was VERY efficient and speedy. Our room was on the 55th floor and we had a view straight down the Strip. The room was spacious and had a well-equipped kitchenette (including Sub Zero mini fridge, Bosch microwave and Cuisinart toaster and blender). The bathroom had a huge marble shower and separate Jacuzzi bathtub, double marble sinks and a flatscreen TV INSIDE of the mirror! The furnishings are very clean and modern and the room felt luxurious.

The best part of the entire room was the bed! It was easily the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in -- IN MY LIFE! The front desk told me they are made by Stearns & Foster specially for Mr. Trump, but that he thinks something similar is available through the company. The sheets were high TC and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.

My complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).

All in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.

p.s. in response to those who say it's ""off the Strip,"" it's not. It's on the older part of the Strip (near Circus Circus), but it's not technically ""off-Strip.""  Also, when it's 110 degrees outside, I don't know who is actually WALKING from casino to casino, anyway!!! Seriously? Doesn't everyone take a cab everywhere?",8/4/2009 1:11

TWICE!  A great place for beer geeks!  They have their entire line-up of current beers to choose from and an excellent little store that you can purchase bombers and interesting things like Trois Pistoles Mustard, Blance De Chambly Orange Marmalade, and Trois Pistoles Blackberry Jam (we purchased all three of these and they are all delicious)!

We hit the restaurant at a weird time (around 4pm) on this trip and they had a limited menu.  We did a meat and cheese plate to go along with a Sampler (3 ounces of Blanche De Chambly, Ephemere [Seasonal], Blonde De Chambly, Noire De Chambly, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles) and Seigneuriale for me and an Ephemere Cerise (Cherry) for my wife.  A minor setback was that four of the six beers in my sampler came out of the bottle instead of the tap, so only two of them had that super-fresh taste, but it was still good nonetheless.  I would recommend finding out what is on draft and sticking with those, though, because those beers will rank among the best beers you will ever have in your life.

Restaurant atmosphere was beautiful.  When we went during the summer, it felt like a lovely cottage house on the lake.  When it was cold in October, it felt like a rustic ski lodge just getting ready for the snow.  Service was very courteous.  We practiced our French this time (as there were some language barriers on the first visit) but both of our servers spoke excellent English.

Definitely recommended to swing through on your way up to Montreal.  Even if you're heading to Quebec City, it's not difficult to get to, just a long trip after you leave.  If you're heading back to the US, just remember that you'll be dealing with the border about a half-hour after leaving and that might not work out too well.  Please note that we were able to purchase Unibroue shirts on our first trip through but we heard a rumor that no more clothes were being produced.  I hope they change their mind on that one!

I have two dogs - one loves everyone (so this was easy for him) and the other is ... a little more hesitant. When I came in, the lobby seemed pretty busy (they were getting low on seating, but not out) and I took a number. I was seen less than 30 minutes later, and never felt like my wait was too long.

When I was taken back, there are tables set up, where the vets and vet techs come talk with you and help your pet. You're not in a separate room (like my old vet). This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think for one of my dogs it was better because while he got blood drawn and a vaccine, he was too distracted to care - there was (what looked like a) lab/pit mix across the room who may have at one point looked at him! How interesting! and that golden over there! What's that smell behind me?

Everyone that works there is friendly, and they work quickly. Since they work rather quickly, don't expect to sit down and have a long conversation. They get to the point, and then send you on your way because there are twenty more dogs to be seen. I never felt rushed though.

If you own pets, you know that they can be expensive. Even small expenses add up quickly. I ended up at Gateway because I priced out my annual vet trip at my old vet and cringed. A lot. I called around and checked out a few other places. I felt like Goldilocks. One vet was a little cheaper, but the staff seemed to hate their jobs and maybe me. Another vet was more expensive but seemed nice. Gateway? Gateway was just right. Gateway didn't offer me any discount, yet I felt like I got two for the price of one (I paid what I would have for just one dog at my old place). My dogs got their vaccines for the next year plus(heartworm and rabies), as well as kennel cough, and one of my dogs got microchipped. Previously I was told that the kennel cough vaccine is given every other year as a shot, and every other nasal - but Gateway had oral. That was so much easier on both of my dogs! One of my dogs is a pug, so the nasal was unpleasant for him and I (on the plus side, last year I got the vaccine as well - since he sprayed it all over me). 

Both of my dogs seemed well cared for while I was there, and got plenty of love. The microchipped dog seemed neutral (and wouldn't take any treats from the vet tech after she took him to get microchipped), but he pug LOVED it. I practically had to drag him out of there.

I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all.

Today I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.
I pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!
I have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.
I called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.

And NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.  No transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  I hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but I am skeptical at this point.

When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...""Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.""  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.

 Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.

Why would I ever set foot in a business who can't even handle the simple task of answering a phone call.


Update* In response to the reply.

A. Of course you are "" lost why I feel that way."" You think its normal to answer a phone call  at a place of business with the greeting ""Speak"" and reply to questions with ""what the hell are you talking about""'

B. You do not remember anything. I never said anything about 3% or California.

After that short conversation I terminated our conversation as stated in my review, so there was NO talk of California or 3%.

When we were done fidling with the food we had to wait another 20 minutes to get someone to flag down our server....finally when she came we had to lie that we are catching a flight just to get the bill at a normal speed. By this point the whole thing was comical....felt like a joint run by teenagers...absolute joke of a place. A lesson well learned...just bc there's a lineup...it doesnt make it good. I actually just got a yelp account to specifically write this review...thats how bad it was. And I eat out several times a week so thats saying something people.",5/31/2016 1:21

I got here at 3:12, sat at the bar by the tv's and then proceeded to wait for a hello or a welcome that didn't happen until finally about two minutes later. I ask about the happy hour to which the woman working responded they don't have a happy hour since they are running specials. I'm a little sad about the happy hour thing being scratched off but I have had The Otheroom to go before and was pleased with the food so I decided to look at the menu and order something good. I then wait about ten minutes before being approached and the whole time I was sitting there was a guy making drinks and nothing else. How can they have only one bartender? It's slow but it's also Memorial Day weekend and you should have enough people working. I understand people want to split your tab and whatever else but there was a third guy who could have handled whatever problem they had at the register. Anyways back to when the woman came to me she apologized for the wait which I didn't care for at that point and proceeded to order my food. Overall the experience I was expecting wasn't a good one. The food was great and a bar with great food but when the service isn't up to par it deserves a low rating. I work in high end retail and know me and many of my co workers and friends around the mall would like to be treated just like any other customer and be given a great service when we go to eat for our lunches.

We bought an air-conditioner from them in 2014 and one just last summer in 2015.  We've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  Not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  This is a unit which holds 5-tons of Puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  We spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  It's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  It had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  So, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it AGAIN.  However, before he did, all of a sudden, I heard the loudest BOOM!  I mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  Then, it had this awful constant noise - like I've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and I didn't know what was going on and I panicked because I wasn't sure if it was smoke or Puron or what so I ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  My roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  Two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  The compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  He tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  Also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  So, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but I may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  The electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (LOL), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  Not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.  This electrician made a point of including some of this on the invoice and gave us the contact information of his friend in case we needed additional assistance with this matter.  Thank God for him and for Yelp and all the Yelpers out there who recommended him. :)

Unless you're going to fill up on side dishes, don't expect to get any value for your money at all.  The place suffers from an identity crisis, part night club part overpriced buffet.

The food is entirely average, nothing spectacular but what absolutely stands out is the fact that every portion of meat I was given was entirely bite size, I literally had already eaten the meat given to me before the guy had even left the table.  I often had to wait 5-10 minutes between 'bites' as they were very busy.

The meat was either extremely overcooked or border line raw (I like rare, this was nearly blue).  As I'm from Texas, I've eaten a substantial amount of cornbread and I can honestly say this was sugar with food colouring and a tea spoon of cornmeal.

We ordered caipirinha's and it was like drinking lime flavoured water with ice and a 1/4 shot of Chacas.

The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.
In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.
The full story.
Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.
After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.
Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.
The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.
The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.
Eventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.
Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.
The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.
The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her ""no"", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.
My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.
So. 
The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). 
We never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.

We started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. 

Then, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned.

The 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. 

And my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal ""Mexican food"" places - I know this place is supposed to be ""New Mexican."" I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.",11/6/2012 4:19

We arrived and immediately put our names on a list, upon asking how long will it be, the lady behind the counter replied, 20 to 30 minutes. That's ok I'll wait a bit and see what happens

I go and observe the range, only 7 spots, seems small but I'll deal with it. I see three lanes open up, range officer says over the radio, three lanes are open. 15 minutes go by, still no one in the lanes. The place is packed at this point.

Other customers are getting irritated. I go back and ask how much longer, she tells me 25 minutes. Another customer starts yelling ""there are three open lanes back there, what's the hold up"" she replies that she didn't know, after I observed four radio transmissions stating three lanes are available and one range personnel coming to the counter to say three lanes are open.

At this point, I had enough, got up and left and proceeded to range 702, where I started shooting within 5 minutes of arrival.

I have spent over 1000 dollars and still not finished from 6+k in damages from the estimate on my car that I left there on a Wednesday afternoon and Geico estimated 15 days to repair it and then was told it was done the next Tues.morning. Corners cut? Anyone with half of a brain would agree. I asked where's my new rim damaged in the accident? Oh sorry here is another Geico adjuster present standing next to my car. Owner says my adjuster Tom Fletcher is an asshole and that the guy present standing next to my car was fair and he said he would get me a rim. And the owner also promised the rim regardless and when I asked how much more to do some touch up paint work he said FREE! Long as I would bring my business to them, from now on. 
     He surely noticed that my inspection was up soon as he promised me BOTH! Then I NEVER heard another word from them again since Dec.2016. And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total. 
    But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed. But guess what happened when I went to actually USE my A.C. a couple months later once winter broke? Hot air. So I took it to Ryan's Auto/Goodyear in Moon. Twp., and explained everything to them. They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks! And guess what else ? I AM AN UBER DRIVER FOR 2PLUS YEARS NOW AND UBER HAS THEIR TEST TRACK BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS SHOP IN HAZELWOOD JUST BEHIND THE RAILROAD TRACKS!

WARNING!!! Do NOT eat here!
Even though the service and food here were both below average, the worst has nothing to do with their bad food/service, but business ethics (the thing that keeps businesses from cheating their customers).
This restaurant, my dear reader, has violated the key principle of doing business - they are cheaters:
They put a couple of sales promotions on yelp to lure you in and spend money, but when it is time to pay, the servers stare at the yelp page i hold in my hand and have the guts to say: ""sorry, we can not honor that...""
Naturally, I asked: ""why not? You put it on your yelp page, so i think you should honor it.""
This is the restaurant's response: ""sorry, but we haven't done that for a while now.""
""Not for anybody?""
""Yeah...not for anybody.""
Well, that was the end of it.

Just had an -interesting- conversation with the girl who answers the phone, Amanda. 
WOW.
After being asking what I was calling for (catering an event, duh!) I told her what I needed, I was put on hold, phone was answered again by Amanda who acted like she hadn't just talked to me 6 seconds before and asked the same question again. 

Her absolutely lack of professionalism quickly wore down my patience. I felt like I was dealing with a 15 year old!!

In the middle of asking me what our date was for our wedding, venue, etc., she blurts out ""Oh, you know there is a 5k minimum for December. You know that, right?"" 
I was baffled by the way she said this, as well as there was no surrounding explanation or context... When I asked ""Why?"" She laughed at me and then said ""Well, thats just our policy."" Okay, that's fine. There are much, MUCH better ways of presenting this to a prospective client. Also, you probably shouldn't say it to someone when you don't know what their budget is or how much they are willing to pay. Moreover, the condescending, rude tone in which you say things like that have a lasting effect. 

They don't know that they are on the preferred vendor's list at my venue, they don't know specific rules or things that the venue already provides and this girl seems to have no grasp of how to get details from someone without asking the most idiotic questions. If someone keeps saying ""We just require a plated dinner, no other services from you."" You don't need to keep asking things like ""what about cake, what about a bartender, what about hors D'oeuvres?"" ""NO! Just a plated dinner."" 

Total incompetence, lack of professionalism, rude, and absolutely not a business who I would recommend working with after this brief and exhausting exchange. 

I wanted to book a simple consultation to try to talk to a coherent adult about food, do a tasting, and then sign a contract --TO GIVE YOU MONEY--! 

To the owner of this business: 
(Before I completely wrote you off as my potential caterer) I requested that when I got my call back, I would like to deal directly with the owner, Jennifer. 
Amanda rudely asked ""Why?!?"" I told her that I would like to deal with someone who knows the venue that I am booked at, (considering you are a preferred vendor there). 
I would strongly suggest getting someone else who knows how to deal with customers, has a better ""table-side manner"", and knowledge of halfway decent customer service.

Heck yeah I'll take it! Ordering through a phone call or going in would be better. Put my order and a couple co workers order in online and paid. 25 bucks gone. Another co worker left to get the food and went to the counter to pick up order. Luckily he made it just as it started filling up with people. The employee at the counter didn't have any idea what he was talking about when he said he was there for an online order pickup. Luckily I printed out my ""invoice"" as they call it and sent it with him. Had it not been for him having that paper they wouldn't have taken the order. I get it, sometimes technology doesn't work right and you get missed. They realized and said sorry and made the order quickly. Now for the food.. we were all excited to try this place as it was new for us all. Every single item we ordered was made incorrectly.

The sweet and sour chicken was pretty much non-seasoned, chicken nuggets swimming in sweet and sour sauce. There were some chunks of green peppers too but I couldn't get over the canned sweet and sour sauce that was infiltrating into my rice pile.

Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.

We ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. 

I was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. 

I must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?

After this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.",8/16/2017 4:15

You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.

The whole notion of loading all your belongings into a box and then having the box shipped to the city you're moving to is brilliant and simple...unless you're dealing with PODS. These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, ""Oh yeah. The container arrived last week."" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.
Next was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.
And then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.
My brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.
Bottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.",11/18/2015 19:10

Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. 
Neo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.
Yesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.
The unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was ""Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled"" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  "" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool"".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said ""Let's take the disabled veteran out of it"".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a ""Show of Force."" We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  

Neo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are 
false. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. 

Secondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  
Lastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  

The entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire ""rigged system""  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. 

I asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.
Additionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said ""thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.",8/13/2016 1:29

I ""Yelped"" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  

My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.

Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.

I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.

I was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. 

Unfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. 

The weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).

My brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail??

As we started getting full I noticed that we had only gotten one soy bean soup and nothing else, later when I had to go pay I asked about our soups and she said ""oh, you didn't get it, I guess I left it at the wrong table "" like wtf? not even an apologize.
After we received the check and people pulled out cards and cash she started to sigh and look annoyed so I just paid and left. It wasn't until after we paid and left we realized we never got one of the meats.

After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. 

A few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  

I called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.

A month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.

Tonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.  

I don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here.",3/20/2011 2:04

I cannot begin to say how bad it was.   I ordered an egg salad sandwich on a bagel and coffee. A simple enough order, or so I thought.  How bad could it be, you're thinking?    Let me tell you:  undercooked eggs with bright yellow, hard jelly-like yolks, chopped in HUGE chunks with an enormous amount of tasteless, gooey mayonnaise on a Montreal sesame seed bagel (the bagel was good).  

Salt, pepper or any kind of seasoning never saw that 'egg salad'.  It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!   The coffee was tepid at best, and the milk I poured into it had some suspicious looking 'flakes' on the coffee that made me think it's last good day was yesterday.   

The presentation was attractive, but what good is that when the food was almost inedible??   I spent almost $9 for food that I could not stomach.

There is a sign on the wall announcing a change in management, which I could possibly have forgiven their lack of knowledge of menu prep if the changeover date wasn't listed as 2010!!

His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  

A friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. 

  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. 

  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.

20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.

I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.

I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: ""patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance"". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service.

On a lovely holiday Monday, after some frisbee in the park, some friends and I decided we needed some food.  The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.  The criteria being: patio, beer and tasty food.  
Well, it had two of the three, however, those two were not enough to redeem this place, especially in light of the laughably awful service.
Now, I'll admit that three of the people in our party got their food and enjoyed it.  However, two of us were not so lucky.  
First we were given the wrong food.  The one other person who ordered at the same time as us (we sort of ordered in two shifts) got his food.  They took back our messed up orders, with the excuse that the computer wasn't working and thus the orders were messed up...uh okay.  Twenty minutes later we recieved the food we ordered, just as our friend was finishing his meal.  Unfortunately, my greek salad came topped with fetid feta cheese and the caesar wrap came complete with bugs squished on the lettuce.  
The good news was that the food was comped.  However, it took us a little too long to pay as the debit machine phone line was being used by a disgruntled employee to complain about her employment situation and to utter expletives in that regard.

The studio and it's salesmanship/service is decidedly less than impressive.   I ordered two pieces, Gorillas in The Mist and Tree of Truth.  The original art dealer who made our transaction was let go for untold reasons and was replaced by someone else(Mike?).   I only know this because I called to get a follwup on the delivery of the photographs because I have yet to hear from the guy who took over the account.  I think if someone took over the account, they should be taking the initiative to notify the customers of that change.  I basically had been getting no response from the emails I sent to my original dealer, and I had to call to find out what happened.

About four weeks later, I received the Tree of Trurth(alternatively called Wisdom Tree).  However, it was only by accident that I received it.  I stopped by my local USPS office to pick up an article by another merchant, and to my surprise the clerk brought me a package from the Rodney Lough Studio.  I have no idea how  long it had been at the USPS office, because I was never notified by Mike, or frankly anyone from this Las Vegas studio that the piece had been shipped out.  I wasn't notified by USPS either, but we all know and expect crappy service from the USPS - the main difference is that I didn't pay USPS thousands of dollars for a certain level of service.  

I am left wondering:

If Rodney Lough Jr. Sells their pieces of artwork as being something of value and something to treasure...Why would they send it via the UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE like its junk mail?? Why not give the customer at least an email notification that it has been sent out???

I wonder if the people at the Peter Lik galleries provide better customer service?  Something that extends beyond the swipe of the credit card?

Nachos came before the drinks and were served with all the ads ons ( that I didn't order ). The drinks came and they were great ! Then came the calamari which was deep fried to a crisp. My daughter who loves calamari actually gagged on her first bite. The salt was intense.

I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.

Frankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me.",9/6/2016 2:10

Spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee. The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either.

Typically hotels in Vegas are known for being extremely catering to their guests. This was not the case. Plus the whole hotel looks like absolute crap filled with the scummiest people. 

Next, my room was absolutely filthy. There were piss stains running down the toilet to the ground, it also smelled like someone died in my room. The bed felt like I should have brought a black light and possibly a hazmat suit. Best part about my room was the AC actually working, but the shower/tub looked like someone had just washed their cars undercarriage in it. The towels felt like sand paper and were barely large enough to be considered bath towels....more like hand towels. Getting a cab is nearly impossible since no where does it say you are required to tell the front desk to call a cab or just call it yourself, since they don't employ someone at the entrance to wave cabs for you. Their room service isn't insanely over priced like most Vegas hotels, but there's a reason for that, everything tastes like it had been made 24-48 hours earlier.

Lastly and most importantly, after surviving 3 nights in this dump, I was brushing my teeth the following morning when I noticed a fairly large cockroach scamper across the sink.

After all this I literally slept at my friends hotel the final night to avoid puking in my own mouth or getting some rare form of malaria.

If I told you how much I paid to stay at this sh*thole, you would kick me in the d*ck for being such a dumbass.

If you're heading east and miss Ambrose, there's no chance to U-turn til Leslie, unless you want to run over city-owned flowers in the median.), we finally parked the car in front of some convenience store in the same strip mall/mini-industrial park building area.

The moment we went past the doors, we were greeted with a motorcycle arcade machine. What is this, Chuck E. Chan? Ah ha, ha., there's a Chuck E. Cheese down the road.

On to the food! A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef. I'll spare you the details, because there are no details. It was all bland. It was as if everything was frozen for Walt Disney's first meal after being brought back to life from his cryogenic sleep. The soup wasn't watered down, but it tasted like it was. The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges. The duck was somewhat of a saving grace. First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper. Spare yourself from attack of the living bland and eat the duck straight up without the wrapping. Second course, stir-fried duck meat. More meh.

I cracked a tooth. EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. 

They are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn't even do it for 2/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) 

THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - 

My opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  

Came in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was ""pay up or get out"" - the officer manager specifically said ""we do not do payment plans"".
